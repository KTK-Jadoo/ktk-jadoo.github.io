Hi, I’m Kartikeya! I’m a Data Science student at UC Berkeley, but more than that, I’m someone who’s always been curious about how technology shapes the world around us. My love for problem-solving and storytelling has taken me down some pretty exciting paths—from building data pipelines and predictive models to creating solutions that make a real difference.

Recently, I’ve been drawn to the fascinating world of real-time rendering and graphics. There’s something magical about how algorithms and creativity come together to bring stunning visuals to life. It’s not just about what you see on the screen—it’s about creating experiences that people can truly feel.

Outside of work and studies, I’m usually exploring something new—whether it’s the latest in gaming, diving into physics, or just jamming with my bass. For me, it’s all about staying curious, learning constantly, and building things that matter.

Thanks for stopping by!
